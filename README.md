# Customer-Segmentation-with-RFM-Model

### Project Description:

Based on the dataset of users registered at Wolt during Sep 2019 and have or not the purchases until end of October 2020, the assignment requires to create a user segmentation approach justificiably that helps Wolt understand what type of users they have.

Every row of the dataset represents one customer who has registered to use the service during September 2019 and either has or hasnâ€™t made orders during the time from then and October 2020.

### The Requirements:

>> + Need to understand well the dataset and present the exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills. 
>> + Need to justify the segmentation approach, instead of an arbitrary solution by a non-data analyst just with slicing-and-dicing with the data.
